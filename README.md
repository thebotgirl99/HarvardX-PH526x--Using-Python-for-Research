# HarvardX (PH526x) : Using Python for research
### The files uploaded in this repository are a part of the PH526x course I took on EdX. 
### Academic Honesty 
> While these solutions will help you to get through the course, please do your best to figure out a working solution yourself before taking a 
look at any of my solutions. HarvardX on EdX will keep tabs on plagiarism. Investing your time and energy into solving the problem sets yourself is 
in my opinion the only way to eventual mastery.
